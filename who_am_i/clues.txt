I was named in the South American team of the year on 2 occasions, and am a CONMEBOL Copa America winner
I was accused of encouraging a chimp to drink beer and whiskey at my son's first birthday party, and photographs of this were later published in FHM
My nickname while playing was "O Animal" (the animal)

My famous FIFA Club World Cup goal (vs. Man Utd) was described by Diego Maradona as, "a piece of genius that only a few players from each generation had the skill to do"
