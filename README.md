# Who am I?

A simple football trivia game, written as a web application in `R` using the `shiny`(https://shiny.rstudio.com) and `shinyjs` (https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/) libraries. The game is summarised below:

- Guess the current or former professional footballer from the clues.

 - Clues are revealed sequentially, with each incorrect guess.

 - The fewer clues needed to arrive at the correct answer - the higher your score!
